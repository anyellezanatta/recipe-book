# Recipe Book

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, that allows searching and creating new recipes.

## Running

Before running the project you must install packages using yarn. There shouldn't be the need to install pods as there's a postinstall script that does that for you.

```bash
yarn
```

To run one of the platforms simply:

```bash
yarn ios
yarn android
```

## Linting, Formatting and Type Checking

To ensure the code quality, the project is configured with standard tooling that is used in any mature project. That is ESlint, Prettier and Typescript. There are useful tasks that help ensure the project is following its standards. You can run them individually as needed.

```bash
yarn compile
yarn lint
yarn format
```
